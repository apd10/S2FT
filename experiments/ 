', 'input': '', 'output': '\nA: Edward made 37 dollars mowing lawns. He spent 21 dollars on mower blades. That means he has 37 - 21 = 16 dollars left. He can buy 16 / 2 = 8 two dollar games. The answer is 8.', 'answer': '8.0', 'raw_output': 'To solve the problem, we need to subtract the cost of the mower blades from the money Edward made:\n\nMoney left = 37 dollars - 21 dollars\nMoney left = 16 dollars\n\nNow we need to divide the money left by the cost of each game:\n\nNumber of games = Money left / Cost of each game\nNumber of games = 16 dollars / 2 dollars\nNumber of games = 8 games\n\nTherefore, Edward can buy 8 2-dollar games with the money he has left.
